### &#128075; Who am I?

I am a norwegian student studying computer engineering at NTNU, Trondheim. Currently on the third year, in which I will finish my bachelor this year, and I'm thinking about starting on my masters degree next year. Besides the study, I work as an assistant in a course for the students in the year underneath me. In addition to this my passion is for sports, technology (obviously), social networking (add me on linkedin) and programming.
