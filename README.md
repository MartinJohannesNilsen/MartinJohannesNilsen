### 👋 Who am I?

I am a Norwegian software engineer, currently working with machine learning at Kongsberg Discovery. Previously, I have had two internships as a full-stack developer, an internship as an ML Engineer, and four positions as a teaching assistant in different subjects, all during my time at university. I'm always motivated to learn more, seek new social relations, and have the courage to embrace discomfort when opportunities arise.

A portfolio of my latest projects is available at [MartinJohannesNilsen.no](https://martinjohannesnilsen.no)

### 🔭 At the moment

I submitted my master's thesis in June 2023, following five years of studying Computer Engineering and Computer Science at NTNU Trondheim. I am currently employed as a Software Engineer at Kongsberg Discovery.
